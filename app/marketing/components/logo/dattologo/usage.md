Our logo is the word “datto” spelled out
in bold, lowercase letters. The
Datto logo is the visual representation
of everything we stand for as a brand. For
this reason, it should appear consistently
across all communications. The logo is
available in a variety of print and online file
formats and should not be retyped in any
application.

# Datto in text
Never use the logo within body copy
or text headlines. You can instead type
"Datto" as shown here, with a
capital “D”. Datto should
never be set in all caps or all lowercase
within copy.

# Logo colors
The Datto logo should be printed in Datto Blue (PMS 2925C) or knocked-out on dark or colored background. Please see the Colors section for more information.
