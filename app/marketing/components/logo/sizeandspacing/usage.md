When placing the logo, give it some
room to breathe and assert itself. Make sure that it is always 1 inch wide when printed, or 100px when used online.

Whenever possible, isolate the logo from other copy or graphic elements by creating an empty “zone” around it equal to the distance indicated by the “X” in the diagram (see diagram
1). The size of “X” should never be smaller than the width of the letter “d” in the logo (see diagram 2). If the logo is smaller than 1.5”, the “X” should still be at least .40”.
