Our bright palette of Datto Blue, Teal, and Citrus speaks to
Datto's energy, optimism, and can-do
attitude. 

# Datto Blue
Of all our primary colors, Datto Blue is special. It should be present on every Datto deliverable, even if it just a fine line.

# Midnight
Sometimes we need to speak about
serious issues, and thatâ€™s when Midnight
comes in. Together with its bright neighbors, it helps us strike the right balance
between youthful exhuberance and
seasoned dependability. Midnight is also the default text color.
